# "I just walked halfway across campus and this machine doesn't sell that..."

Manoa Snackbox is a team-built application for the ICS 314 Software Engineering course. It allows students to login through the UH CAS system and view information about each vending machine on the UH campus. Information includes where on campus each vending machine is located, the products that are sold at each machine, the cost of each product, and additional nutritional facts. Developers are also able to login to add and edit products for each machine.

My contributions to the project included implementing the CAS authentication functionality, creating restrictions for features on the landing page, acquiring pictures for the design of the app, and configuring the deployment of the app to Galaxy.

What I learned from this experience is that communication is key when something needs to get done. Whenever someone communicates on Slack, whether it be a question or a suggestion, something always gets done. At times, days would go by where no one typed in the chatroom, and consequently nothing gets done in the repository. We were able to keep up with the deadlines by gradually communicating more. Communication is a great way to move forward; whenever I am stuck on a piece of code, I could rely on other members because I know they have knowledge that I do not have.
