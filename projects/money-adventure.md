Money Adventure is a stop motion film done in media class. Stop motion is taking pictures of an object while moving it each time so that it appears as if it were in motion. In order to accomplish this visiual technique, I took separate pictures of money and moved them each time. I then compiled all of the photos and put them in a video editor (Final Cut Pro). By playing each photo for a very short amount of time right after each other, it will show the money in motion.

The theme of this film uses money, as seen with the quarters and the dollar. In order to depict an adventure, I used several backgrounds of real places from around the world. I also created the sense of returning home by filming the money entering my room and into my money jar.
