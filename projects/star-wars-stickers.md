Star Wars Stickers is a Java program made in Eclipse for the ICS111 course. It simulates a sticker book in which you are able to click the stickers at the bottom of the book and then be able to place them in the space above. Whenever a different sticker is selected and placed, a unique sound will play for that certain sticker.

When the save button is pressed, the stickers will be saved and their exact placements will be loaded when the load button is pressed. When the clear button is pressed, all stickers will be deleted. It is also possible to move the stickers by clicking on a placed sticker and clicking on a new position to move it. When a sticker is right clicked, it will also be deleted.
