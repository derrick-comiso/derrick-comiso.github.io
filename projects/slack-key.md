This was a music project consisting of a group from music class in which we were to choose a song to perform with slack key guitar. The completion of the project was to perform for a live audience at Windward Community College. The song that we chose was Aloha Ka Manini, a song about the various fish in the sea.

It took the whole semester to work on the project. We first decided to choose our song after liking what we heard it from our teacher. The next step was to practice the song all together so we know how it plays. After that, we were able to come up with parts for each individual, including solos, who would sing what part, who would start and who would finish. As for me I was both start and end the song, and have my own solo. Overall, the end performance was a success.
