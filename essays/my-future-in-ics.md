Software engineering is a whole new experience for me, one that I will hopefully enjoy and find new possibilities throughout this semester. There is not much that I know about software engineering, but that does not intimidate me as I often am open to learning many new things that would eventually benefit me in the future as an ICS student. I have already begun the semester trying to learn new things that would help me in this course, like learning HTML and CSS. All i knew before is that webpages were created by a bunch of words that I had no idea what they meant, but understanding now the depth of what goes into making webpages in enlightening.

I am only familiar with one computer language, and that is Java. With what I can tell from very small bits of Javascript, it can be similar, but I know once I get into it, it will be like learning a new language for a whole different purpose. I hope to become fluent in Javascript and one day create an appealing webpage with my own knowledge.

Not only is knowing the material important, but so is performing under pressure. I hope that with practice, I can complete assignments, experiences, and WODs with comfortable ease. Also, being able to create high quality technical essays is also important in being professional, which will ultimately improve how I am seen by other professionals. Overall, I hope to enhance both my technical skills and my professionalism in ICS.
