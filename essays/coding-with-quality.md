## Coding from Java to Javascript

Ever since coding in Java in Eclipse, having error checking was of great use for me in being able to complete my assignments. It taught me how to arrange my code neatly so that I can identify any errors immediately. Going into Javascript, I was a bit wary of how I would have to change the way I would write my code, but thankfully, with ESLint, my way of writing code has even gotten better. It is, for the most part, similar to how I code in Java, but with ESLint, I can identify any errors that are new to me that come with learning Javascript. 

## Learning code through standards

Coding standards, just like any other language in the world, is a way of conveying things, not only correctly, but understandably. As a result, not only can the coder be able to understand his own code, but also any collaborators potentially looking at their code. Being able to understand your own code is very important in how you learn new things. It will allow the coder to gain a certain perspective on how to solve coding problems and minimize the chance for errors through correct coding style.

## Facing new challenges

Working with ESLint in IntelliJ so far has been very helpful. It made learning new things very easy, such as how to use template literals instead of regular string concatenations and where to put appropriate spaces. Getting green checkmarks, for the most part, has been easy and helpful when doing things I already know. However, when coming across unfamiliar things in Javascript, it is quite hard to get rid of the red arrow. They are not annoying though; I see it as a challenge to fix my code on my own. Overall, ESLint will be very beneficial to me in both the short run, for this class, and in the long run in my journey of learning Computer Science.
