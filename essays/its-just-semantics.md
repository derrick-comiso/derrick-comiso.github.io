## Why Semantic UI?

Being new to UI Frameworks, and software engineering in general, Semantic UI has made website designing much simpler for me. In addition, it has made HTML and CSS more easily understandable. When I first took the course about Semantic UI on Pluralsight, I was overwhelmed with the new system and the way things worked with this framework, but going into the second hour of the video, things started clicking. I can imagine myself coding HTML and CSS with Semantic UI in my mind. Instead of using just raw HTML and CSS, Semantic UI turns that code into something even a non-programmer would understand. If you want something without borders, just say borderless. 

## More practice, more knowledge

The practice WODs especially helped me with implementing Semantic UI for the first time. The yourchoice WOD then allowed me to take what I learned from the previous WODs and use it to recreate a website of my own choosing. Doing this WOD without an example video was a challenge for me, one that I happily accepted. It took me a lot longer than it took to finish the WODs, but eventually I learned new things about Semantic UI, especially its influence on CSS.

## Personal thoughts

I personally feel as if though Semantic UI made a beginner of software engineering more comfortable with website design, HTML, and CSS. Because I was so comfortable with both learning and implementing Semantic UI through the video and the WODs, I found learning the UI Framework to be quite fun. Even if it was or wasn't meant for beginners, I think other software engineers should try Semantic UI just to see if it would make HTML and CSS easier to code, and how different this UI Framework is from others.
